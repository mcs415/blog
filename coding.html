            <p class="article-info">December 28, 2019</p>
                <p class="article-body">Here is a very good resource to get your head around as you start your computer programming career in 2019, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology">Stack OverFlow 2019 developer survey.</a>.  C programming, precursor to the very famous C++ is ranked about 10th in the polls, but is very powerful.  It is at the backbone of all your unix systems.  It's a cryptic dinosaur and depending what you want to do you might wish to look elsewhere but it is still used today in a variety of applications from chess engines to driverless cars. I would like to believe all programming languages are useful and powerful, and a lot of the concepts will remain the same regardless of which one your choose.  Other  non compiled languages that intrigue me are python and javascript.  Python has really created a following amongst everyone, but especially the data scientist professionals.  Javascript is the backbone of the web and runs in the browser.  </p>
