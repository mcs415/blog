            <p class="article-body">I have been spending the last few months trying to learn how to Computer Program.  I attempted to go to a local community college to take classes while fullfilling some of my other obligations and I got stuck taking an pre-requisite math class.  I've learned some of the basics and I hope I can share this with you here.<br>
